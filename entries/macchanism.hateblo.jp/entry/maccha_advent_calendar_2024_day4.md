Hello, everyone!

I'm matchaism (or maccha). I entered UEC in 2019 and started graduate school in 2023. Lately, I've been focusing on my research, part-time job, and preparing for new life as a working professional before graduation.

This is the Day 4 post of the [maccha Advent Calendar 2024](https://adventar.org/calendars/10199), organized by maccha and [azarasing](https://azarasing.hatenablog.com/). Everyone is welcome to contribute articles, so feel free to join us!

By the way, my graduate school journey is entering its final four months, and the deadline for my master's thesis is fast approaching. Looking back on these six years, I plan to share some reflections and topics related to my undergraduate and graduate school experiences. This year, I've signed up for several Advent Calendars, including maccha Advent Calendar, and I aim to write as much as I can about my school life.

Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoy our Advent Calendar and find something interesting or relatable in my posts. Let’s make the most of this season together!

See you in the next post!

英語で執筆してみました．上記の記事は，自力で書いた文章にChatGPTの添削を通したものです．以下が原文です．

> By the way, my graduate school life is approaching to last 4 months, and my master thesis deadline is coming now... So, looking back to this 6 years, I will post some topics relative to my undergraduate and graduate school days. This year, I register some Advent Calendars including maccha Advent Calendar, and I try to write up my school days as many as possible.

原文と比べると，校正後の文章は読みやすく，言い回しも素敵です．ワードチョイスも書き手の意思に一歩踏み込んだものになっている気がします．ChatGPTは日本語から英語への翻訳のほか，自分の英文の磨き上げと英語力の改善にも役立てるかもしれません．

あと，初めの挨拶や締めの言葉などは自分の引き出しにないことが多いので，ChatGPTに任せると楽ですね．これは日本語にも言えると思います．

以上です．今年のmaccha Advent Calendarは25日全てが埋まることを祈ります．皆さんも是非，参加・投稿をしてみてください．
